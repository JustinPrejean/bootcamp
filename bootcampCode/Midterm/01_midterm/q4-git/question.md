1. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?

2. Why is the "index" or "staging area" needed in git? Put another way, why do you use the command `git add`?

### answer:

1. fetch checks for any changes while pull checks for changes and copys files

2. The staging area is used to select files that are going to be pushed/edited. Without it, git would not know what to commit.
