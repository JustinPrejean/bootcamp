### Question 12:

Please use your own simple words to describe what are cascading rules in CSS. Please keep it under 150 words. Full credit given to simple explanation in own words and not a copy and paste from the documentation ;-)

### Answer:

The cascading rules say which items take precident over others. Inline styles take precident over changes made in an external stylesheet. The more specificly selected item will override other selectors. If the specificity is the same then it goes by order causing the last selector in the code will override previous selectors of that item.
