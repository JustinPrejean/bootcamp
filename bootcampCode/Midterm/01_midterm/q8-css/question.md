## Question A:

What color would you expect the item Sweet Halwa to show as and why?

<img src="images/1.png" width=45%>
<img src="images/2.png" width=45% style="padding-left:10px;">

## Question B:

What color would you expect the item "Sausage" to show as and why?

<div>
   <img src="images/a.png" width=90%>
</div>
<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;">
    <img src="images/b.png" width=90%>
</div>

A: blue because it is the first element with the class of .highlight and the selector is more specific by using "nth-of-type" (032 vs 022)

B: blue because ul and li are both elements that only give a specificity of 2 while #must-buy is an id that gives a specificity of 100
