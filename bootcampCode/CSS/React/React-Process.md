1. Fully describe your app
   - who are the users
     - anon users
     - logged in users
     - admin
     - some other kind of users (e.g. customers from France)
   - what are all the things it will do, for which user
   - what will it look like?
     - mockups
     - wireframes
2. Based on the mockups, create a component heirarchy.
   - define which need state and which don't
3. Design the routes - tie them with the nav system
4. Flesh out the UI using presentational components
5. Put together
   - let them have some initial state
   - if needed, let them or their children have some defaultProps
   - add integration with backend
6. Add other stuff like login, logout, protecting of routes
