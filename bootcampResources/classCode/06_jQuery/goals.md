# LEARNING GOALS
We'll be learning jQuery for about a week. It's a JavaScript library that will help us with DOM manipulation.

## The DOM

Understanding the Document Object Model is foundational for web programming.  We'll talk about the DOM in 
class.  For a more detailed look at how a DOM is represented in memory and rendered on the browser, review
this online tutorial

## Self Learning

<h3>TIME required - 1 hour 40 min</h3>
Great way to get your feet wet with jQuery: 

[jQuery: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/jquery-getting-started/table-of-contents)


AFTER you have watched the tutorial above, please take a look at the following:

[jQuery In-Depth from jQuery](https://learn.jquery.com/)

Use this resource as a reference.  When in doubt, you should refer to this resource, or ask an instructor.

Below are two other resources. Both are very credible sources and have done a good job for students in the past.

#  PROJECTS

#### Project 1: Parallax and Particles.js
Let’s take our front end design skills to the next level!


There are a ton of really cool and interesting jQuery plugins that add functionality to your websites. The parallax effect is something that’s been used in a lot of news websites.


We’re also going to use particles.js to create a cool animation effect: https://github.com/marcbruederlin/particles.js


Check out the site for parallax.js: http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/


Your task is to create a SINGLE page site that implements both of these plugins with the following images: 

[City Image](./assets/1.jpg)  
<img src="./assets/1.jpg" width=50% style="border:1px solid black">

[Traffic Image](./assets/2.jpg)  
<img src="./assets/2.jpg" width=50% style="border:1px solid black">


Read the documentation and familiarize how to use them. Use bootstrap for styling alignment of the text, and font awesome for the icons.


Here is an image (compilation of 3 screenshots) the project: 
<img src="./assets/paraPart1.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">
<img src="./assets/paraPart2.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">
<img src="./assets/paraPart3.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">

#### Project 2: jQuery Form Validation

We’ve done form validation before, and now we’re going to do it again with jQuery.


You’re going to create a form with two fields: email and password. If an incorrect email is entered, a message in red is displayed that says 'You must enter a valid email.' If the password is shorter than 6 characters, it will say 'Your password is too short.'


* <img src="./assets/formImage1.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">
* <img src="./assets/formImage2.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">
* <img src="./assets/formImage3.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">
* <img src="./assets/formImage4.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">
* <img src="./assets/formImage5.png" width=90% style="border:1px solid black">


For this project, you will be using a little bit of Regular Expressions in order to validate the user’s email address. While you don’t need to write your own expression (you can just go a Google search for one), this would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with what Regular Expressions are and how they work: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions


Note: you will also want to disable Chrome’s built-in email validator by adding the ‘novalidate’ attribute to your form tag (otherwise theres no point to this project!):  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16269075/disable-remove-the-default-input-type-email-validation-text-overlay-in-fire
