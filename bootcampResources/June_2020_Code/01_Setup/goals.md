# GOALS

## Set up online accounts
  
  - Github.com : you should have already done this by now.
  - LinkedIn : if you don't have a LI account, start one and start building it.  See Job Search section below for some tips.  We shall discuss this more later in this program.
  - Slack.com 
    - Setup Slack client on your desktop (both Windows and Linux if you have both)
    - Setup Slack client on your phone
    - Review functionality.  You may ask for help from slackbot. Try it with `/help`
    - What channels are there?  What are they for? 
    - Direct messaging and 1-to-many direct messaging.  Try it with one or multiple class mate or instructors.
    - Direct message yourself about any reminders to yourself.
    - Try threaded conversations to avoid clutter.  Look for a chat symbol on a message.
    - Have fun with emoji's. Emoji's are preferred as they reduce messages and adequately express the feeling or response.

## **The issues with StackOverflow (SO)** (and the beauty of it): 

  Not everything that is posted on SO is true or accurate.  There is so much that is not accurate that as a student you might sometimes feel lost.  What are the options before you?  Some ideas might include .. 

  **The beauty of SO**

  Take a look at the rating of each answer.  It has to exceed a certain threshold before you believe it implicitly. You decide if you believe it.  If you don't, feel free to do more research.

  **Compare what you know with what you read:**

  Take notes of everything you learn, so you can quickly compare between what you have learned and what you are reading right now.  Use a consistent place to put all your **Lessons Learned** and syntax of each command you learnt.  I like Evernote, since it is quite generous with its free offer and works on most devices, even the browser.  If using Evernote, install the browser extension, so you can save pages that you really like.

## Linux Environment Setup

  If you are on a Apple OSX machine, you don't need to do this step.  
  
  If you are on Windows 10, please setup Windows Subsystem Ubuntu 18.04 Linux on your machine.

  1. Install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on Your Windows 10 machine (10 min).  This is meant for those that wish to stay with Windows 10.  You can have bite of both worlds, Windows and Linux.  Ask instructor help if necessary.  [Suggested Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## Apps Installations

App installations would be done in class.  If you are comfortable with installing apps, you may install these on your own at home.
  
  1. #### Chrome browser : if you don't have Chrome, please install it from Google Chrome's website.
  1. #### VSCode (editor) [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
  1. #### Git Command Line: This is pre-installed on Mac OSX.  Those with Mac OSX machines may skip this bullet.  
    
      Note: do not install the Github Desktop, Atlassian Sourcetree or another Git client just yet.  We only need the command line version now.  

      **Mac OSX**:

      Your computer has this installed by default.  You may skip git installation.

      **Windows 10**:

      Please check if git comes with your computer using the command:

        ```git --version```

      If it is installed, it would provide a version.

      If not installed, your options depend upon using WSL Ubuntu Linux (see above) or not.  Choose the appropriate installation instructions at the site below for your system.
